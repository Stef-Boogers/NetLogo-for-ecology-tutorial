# Agent-Based Modeling for Ecology in NetLogo

## Preparation

1. Install the latest version of NetLogo from the dedicated [website](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.2.1/).
2. Make sure the installation is successful and open NetLogo.
3. Grab the presentation [here](https://github.com/Stef-Boogers/NetLogo-for-ecology-tutorial/blob/7ecc3bbc0941d7db4e13f4862a671f0e17ab5287/assets/Agent-Based%20Modelling%20for%20Ecologists.pptx), if needed. There's a **Download** button on the right.
4. Open the well-documented [NetLogo dictionary](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html), which will answer most questions you have about specific algorithms.
5. Also open the [NetLogo Programming Guide](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html), which will answer all remaining questions.
6. Follow the presentation at 12.30, either in room 01.252 or through Teams. After the presentation, you're ready to get started on the next section! <br>

## Playing with your first model
In NetLogo, go to *File > Models Library* or type `Ctrl+M`. There, use the search bar at the bottom of the screen and type "Fireflies". The tree folder will show one option, under the folder "Biology". Doubleclick "Fireflies" and the model will load. If this fails, you can run the model online [here](http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/models/Sample%20Models/Biology/Fireflies.nlogo).

## Typical NetLogo code structure
All NetLogo models follow the same general structure. Within that framework however, the user has a lot of freedom.
